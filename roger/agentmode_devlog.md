# Agent Mode - Development Log

### 2025-06-26: Project Kickoff

**Entry:** Project initiated. The comprehensive plan for the "Advanced Agent Mode" has been finalized and documented in `agentmode_prd.md` (v4). The plan outlines a five-phase approach to creating a flexible and powerful agent execution engine that supports both custom Python code and external agentic frameworks like LlamaIndex.

Key decisions incorporated into the final plan include:
-   Leveraging the existing model permission system for agent access control.
-   Creating an `OpenWebUIToolAdapter` to allow agents to seamlessly use tools registered in Open WebUI.
-   Implementing advanced UX features like real-time status streaming and user interruption.

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 1 by creating the database migration for the new `agent` table.

### 2025-06-27: Backend Foundation Implemented (Partial)

**Entry:** Completed the initial backend setup for agents.
- Defined the `Agent` SQLAlchemy model in `backend/open_webui/models/agents.py`.
- Implemented the CRUD API endpoints for agents in `backend/open_webui/routers/agents.py`.
- Registered the agent router in `backend/open_webui/main.py`.
- **Note:** The database migration file is still pending.

**Next Step:** Create the database migration for the `agent` table.

### 2025-06-27: Core Execution Engine & Chat Integration Implemented (Backend)

**Entry:** Completed the backend implementation for the core agent execution logic.
- Modified `backend/open_webui/utils/models.py` to include agents in the list of models returned to the frontend.
- Implemented the core routing for the Agent Execution Engine in `backend/open_webui/main.py`, which now detects and routes agent requests to `backend/open_webui/utils/agent_executor.py`.
- Implemented the `OpenWebUIToolAdapter` in `backend/open_webui/utils/openwebui_tool_adapter.py` to handle tool discovery and execution.
- Implemented the `call_agent` tool in `backend/open_webui/utils/agent_tools.py` for agent-to-agent communication.
- Implemented initial context injection in `backend/open_webui/utils/agent_executor.py`.
- Added backend logic for advanced streaming, user interruption, and error handling in `main.py` and `agent_executor.py`.

**Next Step:** Proceed with Phase 2: Admin UI for Agent Management.

### 2025-06-27: Admin UI and Advanced UX Completed

**Entry:** Completed the frontend implementation for the Admin UI and advanced user experience features.
- Created the `Agents.svelte` and `AgentEditor.svelte` components for agent management.
- Created the `agents.ts` API file to connect the frontend to the backend.
- Added the "Agents" link to the admin sidebar.
- Modified `Chat.svelte` and `ChatControls.svelte` to handle agent status streaming and user interruption.

**Next Step:** Phase 5: Documentation & Onboarding.
