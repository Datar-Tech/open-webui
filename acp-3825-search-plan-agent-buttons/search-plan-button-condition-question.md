# Question
If the text inside "Thinking... ^" collapsible pane in each model response message includes text matching SEARCH_PLAN_AGENT_BUTTONS_TRIGGERING_SENTENCE, does it make the search plan buttons show up?

# Answer
Based on my analysis of the codebase, **yes, if the text inside the "Thinking... ^" collapsible pane includes text matching `SEARCH_PLAN_AGENT_BUTTONS_TRIGGERING_SENTENCE`, it will make the search plan buttons show up.**

The key reason is that the search plan buttons triggering logic checks the raw `message.content` directly without removing any collapsible/details content first: ResponseMessage.svelte:881

While the codebase does have utility functions to remove details/collapsible content (like `removeDetails` and `removeAllDetails`), these are used in specific contexts such as copying to clipboard and text-to-speech functionality: ResponseMessage.svelte:160 index.ts:773-777 index.ts:873

However, the search plan buttons triggering condition does NOT use these content-cleaning functions. It performs a simple `includes()` check on the complete `message.content`, which contains all the content including what's inside collapsible details tags.

Notes
-----

The collapsible "Thinking..." content is implemented using HTML `<details>` tags, and since the triggering logic doesn't filter out this content, any text within these collapsible sections will be considered when checking for the triggering sentence. This behavior is consistent with the design that the triggering logic should work on the complete message content as received from the model.
