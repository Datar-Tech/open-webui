Question: 

I'm trying to use llama_index to implement a LLM feature that lets the LLM call any random api server that follows OpenAPI Specification, on its own, assuming those random api servers all have openapi.json.

"The llama-index-tools-openapi package allows you to automatically generate function tools from OpenAPI/Swagger specifications, which the LLM can then call autonomously. This enables the LLM to interact with any REST API that provides an OpenAPI specification document, making it a powerful solution for dynamic API integration. The package works in conjunction with LlamaIndex's function calling agents to provide a complete solution for LLM-driven API interactions."

That's just someone else's description of llama-index-tools-openapi, which I have no idea how to use. Give me a guide on how to use the llama-index-tools-openapi package, with example codes attached.

Answer:

Of course. You can enable a Large Language Model (LLM) to call any API server that has an OpenAPI specification by using the `llama-index-tools-openapi` package. This package reads an `openapi.json` file, converts each API endpoint into a callable `FunctionTool`, and provides these tools to a LlamaIndex agent. The agent can then intelligently decide which API to call based on the user's prompt.

Here‚Äôs a guide on how to implement this, with a complete code example.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Installation

First, you need to install the necessary packages. This includes the core LlamaIndex library, the OpenAPI tool package, and a LlamaIndex LLM integration, such as for OpenAI.

```bash
pip install llama-index llama-index-tools-openapi llama-index-llms-openai
```

You'll also need to set up your LLM's API key. For this example, we'll use OpenAI.

```python
import os

# Set your OpenAI API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Step 2: Create Tools from an OpenAPI Specification

The core of the process is the `OpenAPIToolSpec`. You initialize it by providing the path or URL to an `openapi.json` or `swagger.json` file. The spec object then parses this file and can convert the defined API endpoints into a list of tools.

We'll use the public Swagger Petstore API for this demonstration.

### Example Code

```python
import json
from llama_index.core.agent import ReActAgent
from llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI
from llama_index.tools.openapi import OpenAPIToolSpec

# 1. Initialize the LLM you want to use
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

# 2. Load the OpenAPI specification and create the tools
# We're using the public Petstore API spec
spec_url = "https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json"

tool_spec = OpenAPIToolSpec(
    url=spec_url,
    # Optional: Add authentication headers if the API requires them
    # headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN"},
)

# .to_tool_list() converts the spec into a list of FunctionTool objects
openapi_tools = tool_spec.to_tool_list()

# 3. Create an agent with the OpenAPI tools
# The ReActAgent is a good choice for function calling
agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(
    tools=openapi_tools,
    llm=llm,
    verbose=True # Set to True to see the agent's thought process
)

# 4. Query the agent
# The agent will look at the tools' descriptions and decide which one to use.
# In this case, it will find the 'findPetsByStatus' tool and call it.
response = agent.chat("I want to find all the pets that are available for adoption.")

print(str(response))
```

## ü§î How It Works

The magic happens in how LlamaIndex translates the OpenAPI specification into something the LLM can understand and use.

1.  **Parsing the Spec**: The `OpenAPIToolSpec` class fetches and parses the `swagger.json` file. It reads through the `paths` and `operations` (like `GET`, `POST`, etc.) defined in the spec.

2.  **Tool Generation**: The `.to_tool_list()` method iterates over each API endpoint found in the spec. For each endpoint, it creates a `FunctionTool`.

      * **Function Name**: The tool's name is typically derived from the `operationId` in the spec (e.g., `findPetsByStatus`).
      * **Function Description**: The tool's description is generated from the `summary` and `description` fields of the API endpoint. **This is the most critical part.** The LLM uses this description to decide when to call the function. A well-documented API spec is essential for the agent to work effectively.
      * **Function Parameters**: The arguments for the tool are created from the `parameters` section of the endpoint definition. The agent knows what arguments are required (e.g., a `status` string for the `findPetsByStatus` endpoint).

3.  **Agent Reasoning**: The `ReActAgent` (or any function-calling agent) receives your prompt ("I want to find all the pets that are available...").

      * It examines the descriptions of all the tools it has (`openapi_tools`).
      * It determines that the `findPetsByStatus` tool, whose description mentions finding pets by their status, is the best fit.
      * It extracts the required parameter (`status='available'`) from your prompt.
      * It calls the tool, which executes an HTTP request to the actual API endpoint (`GET https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/findByStatus?status=available`).
      * The agent receives the API's JSON response, synthesizes it into a human-readable answer, and returns it to you.

## üîê Handling Authentication

Most real-world APIs require authentication, usually via an API key in the headers. You can easily handle this by passing a `headers` dictionary to the `OpenAPIToolSpec` constructor. The agent will then include these headers in every API call it makes.

```python
# Example for an API that requires a Bearer token
api_key = "YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_API_KEY"

tool_spec_with_auth = OpenAPIToolSpec(
    url="URL_TO_YOUR_SECURE_API_SPEC.json",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"}
)

secure_tools = tool_spec_with_auth.to_tool_list()

# The agent created with these tools will now be authenticated
secure_agent = ReActAgent.from_tools(secure_tools, llm=llm)
```
