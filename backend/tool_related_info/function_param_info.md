After reviewing `backend/open_webui/functions.py`, I have identified the precise location where the system prepares and executes your pipe function.

The key function is `generate_function_chat_completion`. This is where the backend takes the incoming request, loads your Python module, and passes the necessary data to it.

### Correct Breakpoint Location

*   **File:** `backend/open_webui/functions.py`
*   **Function:** `generate_function_chat_completion`
*   **Line of code:** `res = await execute_pipe(pipe, params)`

You will find this line in two places within the functionâ€”one inside the `stream_content` async function for streaming responses, and one in the `else` block for non-streaming responses. Placing the breakpoint on the **non-streaming** line is usually easier for debugging.

### What to Inspect

At this breakpoint, the `params` variable contains everything that will be passed to your `pipe` function. It is a dictionary, and you should inspect the following keys:

1.  **`params['body']`**: This is the most important part. It is a dictionary that contains the original request payload from the Open-WebUI frontend. It will have the `messages` array, the `model` name (which is your pipe's ID), and crucially, it should also contain a `tools` or `tool_choice` key if any tools were selected in the UI. This is where you will find the tool information you are looking for.

2.  **`params['__tools__']`**: The backend also explicitly prepares a list of tool definitions in this key. The `get_tools` utility function is called to populate this. If tools were selected on the frontend, this list will contain the full JSON schema for each of those tools.

By inspecting `params` at this specific line, you can see the exact data structure your `openwebui_react_agent_function.py` script receives, allowing you to confirm whether the tool information is being passed correctly from the UI through the backend.
