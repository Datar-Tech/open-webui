Based on the `roger/Roger.md` file, here is how you can set up a debugging session for the backend in Visual Studio Code.

The process involves two main steps:
1.  Running the backend server with the Python debugger (`debugpy`) enabled.
2.  Configuring VSCode to attach its debugger to the running backend process.

Here are the detailed steps:

### Step 1: Create a VSCode Launch Configuration

You need to create a `launch.json` file inside a `.vscode` directory in your project root. This file will tell VSCode how to connect to the Python debug server.

1.  Create a new file named `launch.json` inside a `.vscode` folder at the root of your project (`c:/AMD RPA/Github/open-webui/.vscode/launch.json`).
2.  Add the following content to the `launch.json` file:

```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Python: Attach to Backend",
      "type": "python",
      "request": "attach",
      "connect": {
        "host": "localhost",
        "port": 5678
      },
      "pathMappings": [
        {
          "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/backend",
          "remoteRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/backend"
        }
      ],
      "justMyCode": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 2: Run the Backend in Debug Mode

Open a terminal in VSCode and run the following command from the root of the project. This command starts the backend and makes it wait for a debugger to attach on port `5678`.

```powershell
$env:WEBUI_DEBUG=1; python -m debugpy --listen 0.0.0.0:5678 --wait-for-client -m uvicorn open_webui.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```
*Note: I've slightly simplified the command from your markdown for clarity, focusing on the essential parts for debugging.*

### Step 3: Start the Debugging Session

1.  Go to the "Run and Debug" view in the VSCode sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+D`).
2.  In the dropdown at the top, select the "Python: Attach to Backend" configuration you just created.
3.  Click the green "Start Debugging" play button.

The VSCode debugger will now attach to the backend process, and execution will continue. You can now set breakpoints in your Python code within the `backend` directory, and the debugger will pause when they are hit.
